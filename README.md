==============================

Case + Code Overview
--------------------

This repository is part of Real-Time Innovations' Case + Code project, 
a project to create code for real-world RTI Connext DDS use cases.

The example in this repository is meant to illustrate simplified real-world 
uses of the RTI Connext DDS product, focusing on:
- Sending and receiving device-patient mapping data, including Quality of
  Service (QoS)
- Receiving streaming device data
- Making simple correlations between devices monitoring a single patient
- Sending and receiving alarm data

This use case example should be a stepping stone for creating real 
distributed applications based on RTI Connext DDS. Additional information 
about this use case can be found on [RTI's Case + Code page](https://www.rti.com/resources/usecases/medical-devices)
and in the README.md file of this use case example.

RTI Connext DDS Overview
------------------------

RTI Connext DDS software includes the world's leading implementation of the 
Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS). DDS is the only 
open standard for messaging that supports the unique needs of both enterprise 
and real-time systems. Its open interfaces and advanced integration 
capabilities slash costs across a system’s lifecycle, from initial development 
and integration through on-going maintenance and upgrades.
